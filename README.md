# Phaser 3 Sample Game in ES6

This repository contains the game of the "your first Phaser 3 game" tutorial: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game, but refactored in order to use ES6 features like:
* Modules
* Classes
* Spread Operator
* Destructuring assigment

The project is built with webpack. We used the repository https://github.com/nkholski/phaser3-es6-webpack as base example.
